For twelve solitary years, he trudged toward that vision of ""Ever-Normal for All"". Until the Ever-Normal Granary rose tall over golden wheat fields. Until carts of grain from all directions filled them to the brim. For a fleeting moment, his friends' long-ago vow seemed almost within reach. Then the court handed Plainfield to monsters and rationed the grain for war. Cold reality doused the flames of idealism, leaving only embers. Still, he persisted. On his return from a southern inspection, he plotted memorials, strategies, and relief efforts, until a sudden kidnapping interrupted everything. As he was seized, he braced for death, consumed by regret. Then, shocked, he recognized his ""old friend"".\n\nFrom the moment he left Kaifeng, Shen Yilun had never dared to hope for a reunion with A'zheng. So when the initial shock faded, his heart was overwhelmed by grief at his friend's descent into darkness. But in a hidden corner, a tiny flicker of joy began to grow. Part of this joy came from the sheer miracle of A'zheng's survival, but another part was selfishly personal: for the first time, he saw a chance at redemption, a way to undo the mistakes that had haunted him for twelve long years.\nUnfortunately, events soon spiraled beyond Shen Yilun's control. The towering Dawn-to-Dusk Blossom laid bare a cruel truth: the friend he remembered had been buried by chaos, by villains, and... by himself. Shen Yilun refused to accept the shattered promise—especially when it was his grown friend who'd destroyed it. So in those endless dark days, he sought and prayed, until fate led him to another honest, kind-hearted boy, just as it had twelve years before.\nAnd so the towering flames rose again. Twelve years prior, fire had reduced the Zheng family mansion and the teenagers' innocence and kindness to ash. Twelve years later, an even hotter blaze consumed both present-day sins and past obsessions. Gazing at his disoriented old friend, Shen Yilun found that the man's shadow at last overlapped with the boy he had once known.\n""From now on, you are the true Master of Grain.""\nWith those final words, exhaled on his final breath, Shen Yilun knew: This is the end. When he'd begun this path, he'd been certain he'd give everything without hesitation. Yet now, with his wish fulfilled, what surged up wasn't peace, but regret. Regret, and apology.\nFor as his eyes closed, he thought he'd stepped back into the past or forward into an unknown future. There, the ""Master of Grain"" stood alone in endless wheat fields, while young, kind boys laughed and raced through the golden waves, the air thick with the sweet, gentle scent of grain."

So great was the slaughter that rivers were choked with bones, and plague-bearing vermin festered across the land.\n\nA fellowship of heroes begged an immortal for aid. To show their unwavering resolve, the immortal laughed, destroyed their own mountain grotto, and strode forth to join the cause.\n\nYears later, the land was cleansed, save for a single great toad demon lurking in the Poison Abyss. The immortal descended into the depths, bearing the Ever-burning Lamp to suppress the beast. At the climax of their battle, the lamp was extinguished. In its place, a brilliant silhouette appeared as the very mountain shattered and a pure spring erupted forth. The demon was sealed forever in the abyss, which, purified by the sacrifice, was henceforth known as the Gleaming Abyss.\n\nHaving perfected their path, the immortal ascended to the heavens. And in eternal gratitude, the heroes chronicled the epic in the Tales of Immortals. To this day, the common folk honor the sacrifice by lighting lamps and praying to the Big Dipper on the new and full moons.\n\nAn ode commemorates the immortal's lesson: Only through worship can one glimpse immortality.

The Six Cats Monk wasn't a monk yet, and cats couldn't understand sutras yet. \nWhen disaster struck the Pagoda of Karma, an old monk fled and came to the Bodhi Tree. Looking back across the bitter sea, uncertain of the path ahead. Suddenly he heard a soft meow, he turned and found six newborn kittens curled together inside a hollow. The monk shed silent tears. \nThe Bitter Sea remained endless. But now beneath the tree sat one old monk, and six tiny, long-tailed disciples.

That man admired his calligraphy and painting, and praised his craftsmanship. He told him his talent was a treasure, a gift that ought to be used in the ""right"" way. At the end of that year, Twelve Immortals wove a yellow robe using the family's ancient Shu brocade technique. From then on, he became a favored figure before the founding emperor of the Song dynasty.\n\nWorldly-wise yet still a little naive, Twelve Immortals did not understand then that ""the right way"" merely meant being dressed up and used like a pretty little girl. This time, he was simply lucky enough to be favored. Over the years, dressed always in white, Twelve Immortals quietly undertook many tasks for the court. Three years ago, he presented the blueprints for the Five-fang Warship. Now, he had turned his attention to investigating the mystery of the God of Killing.\n\nNot long ago, he learned that someone in Jiangnan still possessed a surviving scrap of silk from the Beauty's Garment. Yet no one in the world could replicate its former brilliance. Twelve Immortals felt a stir in his heart.\n\n""Talent ought to be used in the right way.""\n\nPerhaps, one day, he would be the one to restore the glory of the Beauty's Garment."

2fa5ccb2d1f2827b	Thirteen years ago, in the Dingwei year, during a time of chaos, the Khitan army invaded Kaifeng, unleashing fire and slaughter. The people rose to defend their homes, and after a month of bitter fighting, the invaders were repelled. As the city rebuilt, an old tree in the northwest was found scorched by the fires of war, yet miraculously sprouting new leaves. Seeing it as a divine sign of resilience, the people named it the Immortal Tree.\nLater, when the usurper Liu Zhiyuan founded his short-lived Han dynasty, his sycophantic court seized upon this story. Claiming the tree as a heavenly omen, they forcibly expelled the local residents and built the Garden of Auspicious Omen, adorning its burnt branches with paper flowers to flatter their emperor.\nAnd yet, what came of it? The Liu Han dynasty collapsed in just two generations. A dynasty's fate is not bound to trinkets and omens. How can a ruler in troubled times dare to cast aside caution for arrogance?\nNow, in the first year of Jianlong, with the founding of the Great Song, the realm remains divided.

In hopes of securing peace in Jiangnan, The Shimmer of South sought out The Ember of East, then a fallen noble in Weiyang City, and offered him a path back home in exchange for executing the ""Gold-Making Vessel Theft"" scheme. Their aim is to exploit public outrage over the policy of confiscating Tang Coin, driving a wedge between Zhao court officials and the people, and halting the southern campaign. But The Ember of East, unwilling to see the people suffer, emerged in the Furnace and presented the Treasure Basin Plan, a proposal that reshaped the fate they had agreed upon. Though The Shimmer of South foresaw this change, he chose not to intervene. Compassion stayed his hand. For he, too, was devoted to protecting Jiangnan. And now, his true identity stands to be revealed..."

But when they passed away, a slender woman, as graceful as a willow branch raised him.\nYet, in the end, that woman too was taken from him. When she died, the flowers of Gleaming Abyss fell like snow, drifting endlessly through the air. Amidst the sea of petals, the white-haired man stood, silent and still.\nIt was then that he spoke to the man for the first time.\nThe man, embodying the very essence of Formless Reign, gave him a name. From that moment on, The Void King has become his.\nFor once a beast is named, it belongs to its master.\n\nEver since the Void King followed his master out of the Gleaming Abyss, defeat has never again been his companion. There was only one exception: a single loss to a man carrying a child.\nHis master's face remained impassive, but the disappointment in his eyes was undeniable. \nNo, my lord, please don't be disappointed in me... I am still the Void King Reign you want. I am still the Emperor of Warriors.\nSince then, he has been back in the Pond, vowing to guard the tomb of that woman, swearing never to leave until he claims a thousand heads.\nMore than a decade passes. He is just one head away, one step from fulfilling his vow and proving himself worthy to his master once more.\nHe has to prove that the Void King deserves the name bestowed upon him. That he has not failed his master.\nBut why...\nThe Void King collapses heavily, staring at the indistinct figure before him. He reaches out, desperate to touch that far-off shadow, but in the end, he is consumed by darkness.

The jianghu was thrown into uproar, rife with speculation: Who was the assassin? What was the true bond between the Star Stealer and Zhao Pu? What secrets lay hidden beneath the surface?\nSome say the legendary Canglang Sword Manual, stolen by the Star Stealer during the battle at Wolf Mountain, is hidden somewhere within Zhao's mansion. Perhaps, if fate allows, future seekers may uncover the truth for themselves."

Recently, through the master, I discovered that I had been harboring my hatred for the wrong person.

The kindness of my adoptive father and the revenge for Father Li... I bear both on my shoulders. \n   Only by destroying the ship can I put an end to this.

c4ed5011049a3490	"According to the Offerings from the Mountain Home, the line from Du Fu's poem, ""Trimming spring chives in the night rains"" is often misunderstood as cutting chives directly from the field. In truth, the word ""trim"" is well chosen: to blanch chives properly, one must align the roots of chives (similar to the phrase ""cooking scallions with rounded ends like jade chopstick tips"".) One holds the tips in the left hand, immerses the base in boiled water, and trims off a small portion of the tips. Discard the tips, blanch only the roots until semi-cooked, then plunge them into cold water to crisp. Slice the chives with a bamboo knife. Tender leaves are tossed with ginger shreds, soy sauce, and vinegar for a dish that promotes diuresis and relieves urinary obstruction. A variation calls for adding a few tender willow leaves to the blanching water, enhancing the dish's fragrance. Thus, it is poetically known as Willow and Chives."

e8058900806c6079	"There was once an elderly woman brought to the Evercare Clinic. Her children had long since moved to Kaifeng, and when illness struck, there was no one left to care for her. The villagers, helpless and unsure of what else to do, brought her to the clinic. When she saw Doudou—the boy who delivered her medicine—she smiled and pressed a handful of sweet candies into his palm. He reminded her of her grandson. No one knew why, but from that day on, Doudou visited her every day. He would sit by her side, chat with her, and make her laugh. When Yaoyao asked him why, Doudou simply replied, ""She's kind. Maybe... maybe she's someone I lost—a relative, maybe."" Yaoyao knew the truth: Doudou had no family. He was an orphan, taken in by Unfated Tian. But Unfated Tian had made it clear—never say that in front of the boy. So Yaoyao simply sighed and let it go.\n\nDoudou believed that Unfated Tian could cure anyone. He was the greatest healer in the world, and surely he could make the elderly woman well again. But only a month later, she passed away.\n\nUnfated Tian found Doudou sitting alone by the pond, his arms wrapped tightly around his knees. Unfated Tian sat beside him and spoke gently, ""Birth, aging, illness, and death… they're all part of life's path."" But Doudou didn't understand. If death came no matter what, then what was the point of being a healer? Unfated Tian didn't answer. Instead, he reached into his sleeve and pulled out a small paper-wrapped bundle—candies. ""She knew her time was short,"" Unfated Tian said, ""But you made her laugh. You made her less afraid. These were her way of saying thank you.""Doudou took the bundle in his small hands, and for the first time since she'd gone, he cried."

40e94adbc7070ceb	"A musical piece from the Musicians Institution of the Tang Dynasty, later adopted as a tune pattern for lyrics. According to the Tongdian and Miscellaneous Discussions on Music Bureau, this melody was first played by the son of court musician Wang Lingyan when Emperor Yang of Sui was about to depart for Jiangdu. Upon hearing it, Wang Lingyan wept and said, ""Do is the note of the ruler. If the Do departs and does not return, then the imperial carriage shall not return either."" According to the Essentials of Way and Reason, during the Tang Dynasty, the piece should be a Tai Tune of Do Temple. While the original composition is now lost, surviving versions include Zhonglü Mode with Jin (an extended form) and Banshe Mode with Ling (a shorter form). However, these transmitted versions all suffer from fragmentary codas."

22f6d19bd1609a6f	"Few know the truth about the Coffin Keeper Lord. They are not master and servant—but father and son. Once a proud and powerful duo, the two were captured by Aureate Pavilion and forcibly remade into Sleeping Puppets. By some rare stroke of fortune, they managed to retain their consciousness. Unfortunately, the son's bones were shattered beyond repair, leaving him to live confined within a coffin, while the father lost his voice, becoming mute. To outsiders, it seemed as though the voice inside the coffin was giving commands to its bearer. Thus, they were named the Coffin Keeper Lord.\n\nYet the two of them never accepted their fate as Aureate Pavilion's puppets. Taking advantage of the chaos during Aureate Pavilion's invasion of Qinghe, they fought their way out to freedom. Carrying his son on his back, the father fended off wave after wave of pursuers, finally escaping to a heap of abandoned coffins once used for failed experiments. Since then, they have tried again and again to rebuild the son's body using discarded materials, but success has always eluded them.\n\nIn the deep of night, when all is silent, the son sometimes asks from within the coffin:\n\n""Father, do you think we could ever ride horses, walk dogs, and hunt together again like we used to?""\n\nHis father says nothing. He merely rests a weathered hand on the coffin's lid, and remains by his side in silence."

e64f99c6ea225937	"The rain by the Yellow River was unlike the rain anywhere else in Kaifeng.\nSome said the rain was the tears of the River Deity, trapped in the Yellow River for millennia, crying endlessly.\nQue from the Bujian Hill, hearing this tale, found it amusing: how could the mighty River Deity, who could summon wind and rain, be like a child, wailing at the slightest grievance?\nOtherwise, how else would there be such relentless storms along the Yellow River?\n\nBut Que had never been one to cry. Crying couldn't defeat mountain bandits, fill an empty stomach, or cure a lingering illness. To the sparrow, crying was the most useless thing in the world. The most useful? Her own two hands. When pain was unbearable, she gathered herbs to heal herself. When hunger gnawed at her, she foraged wild plants and hunted animals. When her family was homeless, she apprenticed to a craftsman in Hidden Mountain, learning to build the best houses in the land for her crippled father and blind mother. She believed, up until the day their home was completed, that there was nothing her hands couldn't accomplish. But then, the young doctor from the clinic came running: ""A'que, your parents… they didn't make it.""\n\nSome things, she realized, were beyond human effort. It all seemed to depend on fate. That day, she buried her parents by the new house and walked southward. Behind her, flames engulfed everything. Men were so small in the grand scheme of things, powerless to move the heavens or earth, no matter how hard they tried. So, where should one go? What was the point of all her skills? ""Even the River Deity, who can summon storms in the tales, can't stop the Yellow River from weeping,"" she thought bitterly, drenched in rain.\n\nBut at that moment, the storm ceased.\nBefore her stood a figure in red. ""Hey, you're soaked. Come home with me."""

He lies sprawled on a narrow bed, putting the ledger over his face and mentally calculates how much money he's made this month. Suddenly, the ledger is abruptly snatched. He sits up, annoyed. ""Hey..."" Then he sees who it is: Han Xiangxun. He turns his back to her and mumbles, ""No patients today. I'm going back to sleep.""\n\n""Get up. I need a bottle of Priceless Antidote."" Her tone is chipper, and his eyes light up. Business is business, and gold is gold. He flips over with renewed energy, already shaping a smile to thank his generous patron. But then a thought strikes him. There has never been any serious illness at Heaven's Pier that would call for this medicine. And she, stingy as ever, wouldn't be here unless it were for someone else. It has to be for him. Realizing that, the doctor drops his usual teasing. He turns to his desk and begins preparing the medicine in silence. Still, curiosity gets the better of him. As he grinds the herbs, he asks, ""Is this for that swordsman again? That Hero Chu?""\n\n""That fool throws himself into danger without a second thought. I'm just preparing this in case he winds up half-dead again. Someone's got to clean up his mess.""\nUnfated Tian clicks his tongue and mutters, ""Fool? Who's really the fool here?""\n\nHan Xiangxun shoots him a sharp look.\n\n""Alright, alright. I'm the fool. Only a fool would drag himself out of bed at such a good time to make medicine for someone else's 'fool'."" He pouts, voice soft and petulant.\n\nHan Xiangxun turns away, saying nothing more. Silence settles over the clinic once again, broken only by the steady rhythm of herbs being ground beneath stone."

ce0847b32b3fdf18	"The blade was no ordinary blade. Cutting iron was as easy as chopping wood.\nThe ones holding this blade were not just anybody. There were three heroes: Zhang Long, Zhang Hu, and Zhang Bao. Folks called them Dragon, Tiger, and Leopard, or the Beast Brothers. These three were famous for being strong, clever, and brave. When they joined hands, nothing could stop them.\n\nThat night, wind howled, rain smashed the ground. The three brothers stood together, waiting. The fiercest enemy arrived, but not one of them flinched. Who that enemy was, nobody remembers now. What everyone remembers is, after that night, the old Three Siblings' Mount was gone, and Tiger's Fort stood tall.\n\nWhy call it Tiger's Fort? Easy. Zhang Hu, the Tiger, said, ""Let's use Tiger's Fort."" Long, the Dragon, agreed straight away. Bao, the Leopard, wanted his own name, but two votes beat one. That's how real heroes make decisions—straight and fair."

The Six Cats Monk wasn't a monk yet, and cats couldn't understand sutras yet. \nWhen disaster struck the Pagoda of Karma, an old monk fled and came to the Bodhi Tree. Looking back across the bitter sea, uncertain of the path ahead. Suddenly he heard a soft meow, he turned and found six newborn kittens curled together inside a hollow. The monk shed silent tears. \nThe Bitter Sea remained endless. But now beneath the tree sat one old monk, and six tiny, long-tailed disciples.

15536e843260e9d2	Xue Chou of Kaifeng, a man of mixed Hu and Han descent, was born with an unknown original name. In his youth, he apprenticed under Old Man Xue, mastering miraculous arts: treading on fire and blades, transplanting melons and wells, conjuring clouds and mists at will, and shaping mountains and rivers from thin air—feats that left onlookers in awe. Chou was renowned for his cunning. He assisted Ghostlight Market Elder and Dao Lord Zhu Yousheng in founding the Nine Mortal Ways to resist the Khitan forces, winning great prestige among the people for his strategic acumen.\nAfter Zhu Yousheng's death and as his disciples came of age, Xue Chou retired to oversee the Oil Umbrella faction. He often performed illusionary acts in the Fairgrounds, gaining renown for his craft. When envoys from various states converged on the capital, the Emperor wished to stage a performance to showcase imperial might and entrusted the task to Chou.\nIf later generations of jianghu practitioners are destined to meet him, they may seek his trace at the Beast Reverie Stage in the Fairgrounds—perhaps they will find what they seek.

Among the Southwestern Ponies, those with this distinct red-dappled pattern are called Chibiao.\nLegends from the Huayang Chorography tell of a divine steed that once rose from Dianchi Lake. Its offspring, known as ""Dianchi Foals,"" were said to travel five hundred li a day. Later, during the Tang and Song dynasties, texts like the Book of the Man and the New Book of Tang praised the swift, high-tailed horses bred on the lush grasslands of the region, famed as ""Yuetan Steeds."" These Dian Horses, named for their origin near Dianchi Lake, are also known as Southwestern Ponies.\nSmall in stature, they have fine limbs, a short neck, a broad forehead, and firm, compact hooves. Prized for their endurance, they are suited for riding, pulling, and carrying loads, making them the most common breed in the southwest."

Now, my son Xiao Shi has been granted the rare opportunity to form a marital bond with your beloved daughter, Shen Yu. This is truly a great fortune for the Xiao household and a match made in heaven.\nMy son Xiao Shi, since his early years, has followed our family's teachings and has been well-versed in both literature and martial arts, with a noble character. However, he is currently stationed in the military camp and has not yet been able to return home.\nIn the camp, he is diligent and responsible, earning the respect and affection of his fellow soldiers. But marriage is a crucial matter in life. I have sent word to him, urging him to come home quickly to fulfill this joyous union.\nXiao Shi has long admired your daughter Shen Yu, and his deep and sincere feelings are evident to all. Upon his return, he will surely join with her in harmonious union, like a guqin and a lute playing in unison.\nI send this letter to express my heartfelt sentiments and to extend my greetings to you and all members of your household. May the friendship between our two families endure and may we continue to write a splendid chapter together.\n\nWith the utmost respect,\n\nGeneral Xiao Jun

To protect the people within the city walls, Ye Wanshan sacrificed his family without hesitation, earning him name ""Ironheart General."" But reinforcements never came, and the city fell. This failure became the obsession that haunted him for life. In an effort to rekindle the northern campaign, Ye Wanshan committed a grave crime.

One section on ""Dewcrafted Brew"" read: ""A hundred and twenty kilograms of glutinous rice, ten taels of yeast, blended with two hundred and forty kilograms of mountain dew. Let it ferment under cloudy skies for seven days, and fine wine shall form.""\n\nLi Zuo somehow found this scroll and showed it to Liu Qingyi. The two grew interested in the Dewdrop Wine and agreed to secretly seek mountain dew in the morning. As day turned to night and the path ahead was unclear, Liu Qingyi accidentally missed her step. Before she could call out ""Zuo""—the name that always comforted her—she saw Li Zuo grab her and get pulled down the hillside with her.\n\nMiraculously, a pair of twin peach trees broke their fall. Amidst the snowfall of pink petals, a single drop—like mountain dew—landed on Liu Qingyi's cheek. Startled, she turned, only to meet the boy's eyes, brimming with unrestrained joy."

2c5a7f1b429565f3	"During the Xiande era, there was a knight-errant in Qinghe's Moonveil Mountain. Her real name remains unknown, but people said she came and went without a trace, and her sword strikes left no mark. Like the radiance of the moon and the glow of stars, she was ethereal and beyond the mundane, so she was widely known as the ""Lunar Goddess"" in the martial world.\nThe Lunar Goddess rarely failed in assassinations. Although many in the market offered a thousand gold coins to hire her, she ignored them all. At the end of the Xiande era, when envoys from Khitan passed through Qinghe, numerous chivalrous warriors ambushed them, intending to kill the envoys and avenge national hatred.\nSuddenly, human heads were seen flying up, and all the ambushing warriors were slain by the Lunar Goddess! The world then reviled the Lunar Goddess, who vanished without a trace, and no one knows where she went. \nSome once saw the Lunar Goddess enter the lake at Moonveil Mountain's #YCrimson Cliff#E, never to be seen again. Those who searched later found only the Goddess's reflection, singing to the moon with a clear voice that lingered endlessly."

6baa83f96b4643b4	Many years ago, the original Bodhi Root was just an ordinary tree. And the Bodhi Sea wasn't a swamp. The Six Cats Monk wasn't a monk yet, and cats couldn't understand sutras yet. \nWhen disaster struck the Pagoda of Karma, an old monk fled and came to the Bodhi Tree. Looking back across the bitter sea, uncertain of the path ahead. Suddenly he heard a soft meow, he turned and found six newborn kittens curled together inside a hollow. The monk shed silent tears. \nThe Bitter Sea remained endless. But now beneath the tree sat one old monk, and six tiny, long-tailed disciples.

5073d02a0d3ed30b	"Qiu Yuehai, a man of Jin, was famed for his mastery of the twelve-foot spear. With lightness skill and peerless technique, he could leap as though treading among the stars; his spear tip seemed fit to challenge even the mighty Kunpeng. Those who saw his heroic bearing called him a true champion among men. It was said at the time: ""We may not see Liezi riding the wind, but in Lord Qiu's soaring dance, he seems to grasp the sun and moon themselves!""\nI once heard that, beneath an ancient tree in Qinghe, a dozen wine jars were arranged like stars in the sky. A hero passed among them with a spear in hand—moving so swiftly, not a single drop of wine was spilled, nor did a flower petal stir in the breeze. People called him the #YWine Jar Celestial#E. Looking back now, I believe that must have been none other than Qiu Yuehai himself."

It was then that a wandering monk arrived, calling himself Miaoshan, a disciple of Master Baozhi from a hundred years ago.

Loyal patriots rallied together, calling themselves the #Y""Northern Alliance,""#E retreating south to Qinghe to resist the Khitan forces and serve as a bulwark for the realm. I once fought alongside these righteous men, witnessing how mountains and rivers lay shattered, blood flowing so profusely that it could float pestles. Today's Qinghe (Beizhou) is no different from Suiyang during the An Lushan Rebellion! Alas! One man's might can hold a pass against ten thousand, and the fate of a single city may decide the safety of the world. What defines a hero? They care not for their own longevity, but for ensuring the people remain free from harm.\nIn the late Xiande era, I passed through Qinghe, and in #YVerdant Wilds#E, the ringing of bells rose to the clouds.

55f6217a2f841a47	The Imperial Artisan Court, formerly known as West Market. In the 1st year of the Jianlong Reign (960 CE), the imperial court built the Imperial Works Bureau here, recruiting skilled artisans from across the land. As commoners prospered through trade, the area was renamed the Imperial Artisan Court—though locals still call it West Ward. It's said the Xingyang Zheng family once had a villa here. Two years ago, the Imperial Works Bureau demolished it, citing the Zheng clan's decline and long vacancy, then built the Artifacts Bureau on-site after unearthing countless rare curios in a hidden chamber. The district hosts not just carpentry and blacksmith workshops, but also porcelain kiln, dye works, paper workshops, and Shipyard Bureau—forges burn day and night. Kaifeng's canal checkpoint, Tianjing Dock, is also located here, strangely overseen by the Jade Serpent Hall.

Thus the name Ever-Normal Granary. \nYet even so—plenty is rare, peace even rarer. \nOutside the granary, on the great Plainfield, one side rejoices, the other weeps. One grain of wheat, one kernel of millet, each weighs with it the fate of the people.

Among the Southwestern Ponies, those with this red and white mixed pattern are called Chizhui.\nLegends from the Huayang Chorography tell of a divine steed that once rose from Dianchi Lake. Its offspring, known as ""Dianchi Foals,"" were said to travel five hundred li a day. Later, during the Tang and Song dynasties, texts like the Book of the Man and the New Book of Tang praised the swift, high-tailed horses bred on the lush grasslands of the region, famed as ""Yuetan Steeds."" These Dian Horses, named for their origin near Dianchi Lake, are also known as Southwestern Ponies.\nSmall in stature, they have fine limbs, a short neck, a broad forehead, and firm, compact hooves. Prized for their endurance, they are suited for riding, pulling, and carrying loads, making them the most common breed in the southwest."

c9332b8ec61cec29	"Unfated Tian never planned to raise two children.\nTwo children!\nNot flowers or grass, not cats or dogs. You can't just half-heartedly raise kids.\nOnce you take them in, there's no turning back. You're tied together for life. You have to feed them, teach them skills, and drill morals into them. And if you do a bad job? Well, what if they grow up to be neighborhood tyrants?\nSo at first, Unfated Tian had no intention of taking these two in as disciples.\nBut the younger boy's face was a ruined mess, tears streaming endlessly, while the girl clung to Unfated Tian's sleeve, her eyes wide and pleading....\nFine, fine.\n""From now on, you're Doudou, and you're Yao Yaoyao. Understood?""\n\nAs for why ""Doudou"" and ""Yaoyao""? Unfated Tian put serious thought into it. Even if it sounded like a joke.\nFirst, Doudou always looked so sorrowful. So he gave him three ""dous"" (to tease), ensuring he'd grow up laughing.\nSecond, Yaoyao was sickly as a child. So he loaded her name with ""yao"" (medicine), hoping she'd stay healthy.\nCorny? Maybe. But it worked. Against all odds, Doudou and Yaoyao grew up just as he'd wished.\nUnfated Tian wasn't a Buddhist, but whenever he thought about it, he couldn't help muttering a silent Amitabha.\nYaoyao shed her ailments, becoming a carefree girl who laughed at everything. Doudou, too, stopped moping like a little rain cloud. He even smiled sometimes, a proper, childlike grin, and was fiercely filial. Yet...Too filial, Unfated Tian sighed. That tiny heart carried too much weight. If only he'd learn to live lightly.\n\nUnfated Tian poured his soul into figuring child-rearing out.\nThe worst challenge? Stopping nighttime crying.\nOne wailing child is bad enough. Unfated Tian had two in one house.\nAnd they'd compete. One would start, the other would escalate, a duet of misery lasting half the night.\nIn those moments, alone on his remote mountain in Blissful Retreat, far from human noise, Unfated Tian truly understood the phrase: ""It's lonely at the top.""\n\nDesperate, he even swallowed his pride to ask that insufferable Jiang Wulang for advice.\nGreat Hero Jiang, how do you soothe a child at night?\nJiang Wulang smirked.\nMine never cries....Jiang Wulang is the worst.\nLuckily, through trial and error, Unfated Tian discovered a solution:\nTelling jokes. Terrible jokes. \nThe kind that'd make normal people shiver from sheer awkwardness.\nBut without fail, they silenced Yaoyao and Doudou.\nUnfated Tian preened at his genius. Meanwhile, the kids would exchange a glance and burst into exaggerated laughter, playing along every time."

c5b86568a86c0a09	The Horse Tamer has no name, or perhaps he once did, but has long since forgotten. He is followed everywhere by an old horse fond of dancing, so others mockingly call him the Horse Tamer. \n\nHe was an ordinary man, once taken in by Aureate Pavilion. Unfortunately, he had no talent for martial arts. So they sent him to the Cocoon House, where he became a test subject for Sleeping Puppet experiments. Clearly, he lacked any special traits, he failed the drug trial and was quickly discarded in the mass grave. But just as he was about to die, a warhorse saved him. \n\nThe Horse Tamer has never truly felt alive. He has no morals, no sense of right or wrong, no desire to live, and no fear of death. The only real thing in his life may have been that warhorse. He's always wondered, why did the horse save him?

In the early days of Xiande, Buddhist fervor swept through Qinghe, and in this village, devotion grew ever more intense, bordering on madness. A wandering monk known as Miaoshan came to the village and declared, ""Your worship is naught but hypocrisy.""

Houses vanished into a sea of flames, and for ten miles, nothing remained but scorched earth—none survived.\nSome years later, in the Jianlong era, as travelers passed the desolate ruins in the depths of night, one heard the sound of quiet weeping rising from the wasteland. He said to his companions, ""Could these be the lonely spirits of the villagers, still unwilling to find peace?"""

d09920b7e3c82690	"East of Jadebrook Mountain lies a vast swamp known by a name of profound paradox: the Bodhi Sea. A sea of suffering, yet a place of enlightenment.\nLegend claims its hopeful beginning traces back to the Tang Dynasty, when the great monk Xuanzang preached here. Inspired, a master named Yongfu attained enlightenment and planted a single Bodhi sapling by the water's edge. That tree now stands majestic, its canopy a vast, sheltering pavilion—a lone symbol of the grace that once was.\nBut this grace soured. During the Xiande era, the zealous monk Miaoshan led his followers into the swamp's heart. There, they built the Karma Pagoda and imprisoned a hundred sinners within. Guided by the tenet, ""The sea of suffering is boundless, yet repentance is the shore,"" the monks outside began a ceaseless vigil. Morning bells and evening drums echoed across the waters, an unending ritual meant to cleanse the prisoners' souls.\nThen, Master Miaoshan vanished. The prisoners, their penance unfinished, shattered the pagoda's walls. The Bodhi Sea, once a place of potential salvation, devolved into a hell on earth. Of the great pagoda, only shattered ruins remain.\nTo this day, locals whisper of faint, sorrowful wails drifting from the swamp's depths. They attribute the sounds to the vengeful spirits of those who perished in the tower, though such tales are likely just superstition."

dd5af21c6638e748	From Mercyheart Town go through the north gate, crossing the rocky creek, and travel ten miles, where the path forks. Heading east toward Jadebrook Mountain, after another thirty miles, one arrives at Thousand-Buddha Vale.\nOriginally an unnamed gorge at the foot of Jadebrook Mountain, it abounded in hard stone—thus craftsmen from Mercyheart Town often quarried here to carve Buddha statues. What's more, over a hundred Buddha sculptors, to show their piety, sculpted thousands of Buddhas in the valley: standing or reclining, in all manner of postures. The tallest exceed a hundred feet, exuding majestic dignity—a truly remarkable feat of craftsmanship.\nYet the grandeur of Thousand Buddhas was never completed, for during the Xiande era of the previous dynasty, Emperor Shizong suppressed Buddhism. Since the suppression, the stone carvings remain, but faith has faded, and the thousand Buddhas have been neglected for ages.

In this 5v5 competitive mode, players can form teams of five to engage in strategic battles.\n 5v5 Arena is open every Friday to Sunday, with entry available from 19:45 to 20:00. Be sure to join in on time. Once the match begins, up to four teams with similar ranking points will be grouped into a round-robin bracket. Each group will play three matches, with each match using a best-of-three format. Teams that win a match will earn season points and Activity Points.\n\nIn this mode, healing effects are reduced by 70%. After a certain time in battle, players will deal increased damage while healing effectiveness is further reduced. Using the ""Deflection"" skill consumes Endurance, but successfully executing a finisher restores it.\n\nMost player skills can be countered using ""Deflection."" However, Armor-Piercing Mystic Skills can't be blocked this way and are especially effective against defensive targets or those using ""Deflection""—though they can be interrupted by any skill.\n\nVarious player skills (including Mystic Skills and Charged Skills) can interrupt light and heavy attacks, but not the other way around.\n\nMastering crowd-control removal skills can turn the tide of battle when at a disadvantage."

4a328f97851b1e3f	Dragon's Breath is my family's secret art, passed down from a martial master of the former dynasty. My father wished to teach me this mystic skill, but in my youth, I dismissed such street performances as lowly tricks and refused to learn. I dreamed only of mastering sword and script, achieving great feats. For years, I wandered with my family, performing for a living.\n\nOne day, when war broke out, I found myself defenseless. Hiding in the shadows, I wept as my sister was lost. Just as blades were about to fall, my father arrived and used Dragon's Breath to drive back our foes and save us all. Only then did I realize that there are no lowly skills or inferior arts, for true strength lies in self-preservation and protecting others.

ce8b07da20526c46	"The moment the ""sacrifice the plum for the peach"" scheme was completed, Feng Ruzhi had already wondered: Would Zheng E turn back?\nShe knew how absurd this speculation sounded at first glance. After all, from that bloody night of the marauder uprising, to the ""Dawn-to-Dusk Plague"", and the catastrophic floods... over the past twelve years, he had endured far too much. Yet according to her late mother Zhu Yu's accounts, Zheng E had never been a heartless man. The ""A'zheng"" who existed only in stories was righteous and kind, a man who shared a deep bond with Shen Yilun. Their ideals had once embraced all of Kaifeng commoners, including the townsfolk of Gracetown.\nAs their mission neared success, her unease grew. Pretending to transport supplies, she risked taking a small boat through black markets and dark rivers to the underground Ever-Normal Granary, hoping to gauge her brother's resolve. But she was no good at hiding her feelings, and the worry on her face gave her away before she even spoke.\n\n""I won't waver,"" Zheng E said bluntly. ""No peace for the good until all evil is eliminated.""\n""But… what if the Song court returns the land, and Gracetown repents…""\n""I won't waver,"" he repeated. ""Evil doesn't repent. A wolf in sheep's clothing is still a wolf. It will always hunt sheep.""\n""But...""\nFeng Ruzhi opened her mouth to speak again, but this time, Zheng E cut her off without hesitation.\n""Ruzhi! A'ruan is dead, Zhu Yu is dead, everyone is dead… *coughs*...""\nAfter saying this, Zheng E was suddenly seized by uncontrollable coughing. When he finally regained his breath and spoke again, each word seemed to carry a deathly chill.\n""I have few loved ones left. They deserve to live. They must live. That's why I can't waver."" Zheng E fixed his gaze upon her, and Feng Ruzhi flinched as if pierced by its sharpness. She fell silent, startled by the despair that had seeped into those few words. An irrevocable sorrow, and a resolve past the point of no return, quietly took root between them.\n\n""Do not come again."" His voice was curt, final. ""If even you were to succumb to the cold poison... I could never face Master Zhu Yu again."" With visible effort, Zheng E pushed himself upright, his bones emitting the faint, grating creak of a palsy patient. Yet not so much as a flicker of pain crossed his face. Wordlessly, he shouldered open the heavy iron gate and strode into the shadowed corridor beyond without a backward glance. He wore a white cloak, but the silhouette was swiftly devoured by the gloom cast from the massive Dawn-to-Dusk Blossom.\nFeng Ruzhi stared long after he had vanished before finally lowering her eyes. Once more, she thought of the youth her mother had so often described, a boy who clung fiercely to his dream of ""Ever-Normal for All"", surrounded by comrades who shared his cause, by kin who loved and believed in him, his heart brimming with untainted hope.\n""What a pity,"" she mused. ""If only he could have lived. I would have liked to meet that version of him."""

Yet the Fates abhor excess—none remain whole, none stay joyful. After Emperor Shizong's death, the Song Dynasty replaced Zhou, and the Yellow River burst its banks at Huzi. Torrential floods swallowed all... Thus did the world turn, never to return..."

a52a447a8a0ddd99	Thirteen years ago, in the Dingwei year, during a time of chaos, the Khitan army invaded Kaifeng, unleashing fire and slaughter. The people rose to defend their homes, and after a month of bitter fighting, the invaders were repelled. As the city rebuilt, an old tree in the northwest was found scorched by the fires of war, yet miraculously sprouting new leaves. Seeing it as a divine sign of resilience, the people named it the Immortal Tree.\nLater, when the usurper Liu Zhiyuan founded his short-lived Han dynasty, his sycophantic court seized upon this story. Claiming the tree as a heavenly omen, they forcibly expelled the local residents and built the Garden of Auspicious Omen, adorning its burnt branches with paper flowers to flatter their emperor.\nAnd yet, what came of it? The Liu Han dynasty collapsed in just two generations. A dynasty's fate is not bound to trinkets and omens. How can a ruler in troubled times dare to cast aside caution for arrogance?\nNow, in the first year of Jianlong, with the founding of the Great Song, the realm remains divided. Our Emperor, taking this tale of hubris as a solemn warning, has decreed that the garden be remade. It is renamed the Garden of Vigilance and returned to the people, a testament to his vow to rule with virtue, to remain ever-cautious, and to protect the nation and its people.\nDecreed and erected in the seventh month of the first year of the Jianlong era

It was said that a secret sect called Hollow Vale was founded upon its power. Yet for reasons unknown, the sect soon vanished from the Jianghu. As chaos engulfed the Tang dynasty, the poison master Sun Buqi revived the Sleeping Puppet, unleashing a calamity that shook the Jianghu. \nToday, the Hollow Vale is home only to those afflicted by this very scourge. Shunned by all, they have sealed themselves within the valley, clinging to the hope that one day they might be able to break the Sleeping Puppet's curse.

These people wouldn't understand a human's cry for help, let alone a beast's.\n\nThe moment moonlight squeezed through the window, she arched her back, let out a low growl, and stared at that faint strand of moonlight, throwing herself against the dog cage—over and over. Fresh blood and tears stained the dried blood on the cage.\nThe brief memories of once being human had long been blurred by her years with the wolf pack. She only remembered moon after moon.\nThe full moon in the sky was the night she fled the Zheng family and stumbled into the wolf pack.\nCountless moons spent living with the wolves, huddling together for warmth.\nThis human place terrified her; she wanted to return to her moon.\n\nDay after day, a wolf that couldn't be tamed into a dog eventually became human food, torn apart and discarded.\nThe Wolf Maiden, having shattered the cage, looked up at the moon—it looked just like the moon the night she fled the Zheng family. She ran toward the wolf pack as if returning home, letting out a plaintive howl. Moonlight spilled over her scar-covered back.\nIn this world, humans saw her as a dog, but wolves saw her as a wolf."

8f97e31b2b9c3b57	"At Zi hour, Feng Ruzhi once again stood by the Yellow River, staring out at the sails fluttering faintly in the moonlit breeze, waiting for the one who had promised to come home.\n\nShe remembered. A long, long time ago, when she was still a little kid, there had been someone else standing by the riverbank, arms akimbo, waiting. That figure, chewing on a sprig of foxtail grass, hair tousled like the wind had scruffed it apart, was a little frightening under the moonlight. Back then, A'Cuo had still been timid, unlike herself, who was already bold and brash. Without a second thought, she had grabbed A'Cuo by the collar, barreled past the cook standing at the doorframe, and sat down at the table in one breath.\n\nThree seconds. Within three seconds of sitting down, the jibber-jabber would start.\n\n""How many times do I have to tell you? Do not stay out playing until it's dark!""\n\n""With your half-baked skills, if you run into the Unbound Cavern, you'll end up sold to the Ghost Revelry Hall!""\n\n""Don't you dare play dead! I'm talking to you, A'Ru! You too, A'Cuo!""\n\nIf ""Fox"" A'Zheng was around, he'd strike a pose and try to smooth things over:\n\n""Master Pops, come now, don't stand in the doorway. I'll keep an eye on them next time. It's not good to keep the master waiting, either.""\n\nIf Mother were to clear her throat and look toward the door, that cook would instantly droop his head and shuffle himself inside. That was the signal for another peaceful night.\n\nThe moonlight remained the same. But the people beneath it were gone."

c6946c94c0f2f05d	"The tradition of floral wines runs deep. In Nine Songs, Qu Yuan wrote, ""We pour pepper sauce and laurel wine; serve spiced meat in orchid bowls."" Mei Cheng, in Qifa, noted, ""Orchid wine, used to rinse the mouth."" From commoners to scholars, all delighted in infusing blossoms into their brews. In the Ghostlight Market, the famed Netherworld Wine is made from red spider lily stamens steeped in the waters of Huang Quan. Legend says that over a decade ago, a drunken wanderer, captivated by the lilies blooming along the riverbank, plucked a few stamens and brewed them with the underworld's water. Upon drinking it, he claimed to see his brightest memories and deepest longings come vividly to life. The brew quickly drew throngs of curious merchants. But locals were alarmed. Xue Chou warned that both the flowers and the water were poisonous. Yet after careful study, Physician Tushan discovered the toxins neutralized each other, creating something wholly new. Since then, Netherworld Wine has remained one of the Ghostlight Market's most coveted secrets."

4dd9fc0dd44b20ac	"1The Shuowen Jiezi states: ""Cong refers to a horse with a blue-white mixed coat."" Famed steeds like the Azure Colt and Jade Flower Cong all bore this coloring. Another theory suggests Cong symbolized a ""land dragon,"" a metaphor for incredible speed, which is why pure blue or white Tuyuhun horses were so highly valued.\nLegends say the Ganlong region produced fine ""Qin Horses"" as early as the Qin Dynasty. Later, the Tuyuhun people settled there to graze their herds. According to the Book of Sui, a myth tells of a Persian stallion that bred with a local mare near Qinghai Lake, producing a Cong colt that could run a thousand li a day. This legendary colt became known as the Tuyuhun Horse.\nMuscular and well-proportioned, the Tuyuhun Horse is strong yet gentle and easy to train. These horses are highly social, moving in herds led by a dominant stallion. With keen ears and sharp eyes, they are intelligent, alert, and fiercely loyal to both their kind and their master. Suited for riding and light draft work, they became one of the most common breeds in the Central Plains."

""Go cheat someone else out of their money.""\n\nHe had imagined many possibilities for his life: maybe the fastest street runner in the world, a petty thief stealing gold in bustling markets, or a lazy fisherman who only caught one fish a day, just enough to eat. Either way, he'd be small, ordinary, unremarkable. After all, he had no extraordinary Martial Art Skills, just quick legs. This wasn't a storybook. Where did ordinary people get legends? Just live your life, he thought.\n\nBut years later, he learned that life isn't something you can simply ""live well"" if you want to. The raiders who stormed into his home, burning and pillaging, didn't listen to his pleas. ""Please, I don't want to meddle in anything—just let me be!"" Who did he think he was? Warhorses neighed, their iron hooves shattering soldiers' armor and crushing commoners' rooftop tiles alike.\nSo he buried the uneaten fish alongside the bodies of those who'd closed their eyes forever, gripped the last long spear in the village, nodded to a man named Lie Yan, and walked into the distance together.\nThere, in Verdant Wilds, people were already waiting: tall and short, old and young, shadow play singers, and white-bearded elders.\n\n""Hey, I'm Qiu Yuehai.

Blossoming in February, its jade-colored clusters appear just before midnight and fall soon after; people rarely get to see its flowers.

Those were the words Cao Zhi had written for the Water Lady, the same ones Unfated Tian had borrowed for his masterpiece, the perfume he'd crafted just for her.\n\nIn these turbulent times, agarwood was worth its weight in gold.\nFortunately, the Evercare Clinic still had a stash of imports from Fuling. This particular ingredient was priceless, and Unfated Tian allowed no one else to touch it.\nAgarwood was rich and heavy, clinging to fabric for days. This is a fragrant medicine that could ward off evil and calm the mind.\nWith careful precision, he scraped a few flakes into a porcelain dish. He hesitated, then added two more.\nUnfated Tian always gave Han Xiangxun the best and kept the worst for himself.\n\nBlissful Retreat announced that Madam Han had left to source fresh ingredients, but business would continue as usual.\nMeanwhile, in the wilds of Qinghe, several Khitan scouts were found dead. They were poisoned, with no trace of the killer.\nRumor had it their insides had liquefied. Even vultures wouldn't go near them.\nNo one knew Han Xiangxun was lying wounded at the bottom of a well, recovering from injuries sustained at Still Shore.\n\nThe night she woke, she summoned Unfated Tian to meet her there.\n""You shouldn't have acted so recklessly.""\n""You suspect me? I'm a doctor. How could I kill?"" He put on an exaggerated look of hurt, though the amusement in his eyes betrayed him.\nHe knew his acting wouldn't fool her.\n""No experience. Got carried away."" After she left, Unfated Tian sighed.\nIf staining his hands with blood kept her safe, so be it.\nEliminating everyone who'd seen her that night was the only way to ensure her peace. Especially when she'd been hurt so badly.\n\nThe scent of blended perfumes brought him back to the present. As he finished the new mixture, a faint smile touched his lips.\nWhen Unfated Tian left Han Xiangxun's room, the water clock marked the deepening night.\nSoft moonlight spilled into the chamber. Beside her bronze mirror sat a fresh porcelain vase."

According to the Tongdian and Miscellaneous Discussions on Music Bureau, this melody was first played by the son of court musician Wang Lingyan when Emperor Yang of Sui was about to depart for Jiangdu. Upon hearing it, Wang Lingyan wept and said, ""Do is the note of the ruler. If the Do departs and does not return, then the imperial carriage shall not return either."" According to the Essentials of Way and Reason, during the Tang Dynasty, the piece should be a Tai Tune of Do Temple. While the original composition is now lost, surviving versions include Zhonglü Mode with Jin (an extended form) and Banshe Mode with Ling (a shorter form). However, these transmitted versions all suffer from fragmentary codas."

Not even when the floodwaters rose high enough to drown the sky; Not everyone is born to be the hero of a storybook. He is not the kind who saves the world, and certainly not some imagined god. Because it isn't worth it. People aren't born to live for others. Roaming in this vast and indifferent world, in the end, we all come and go alone. We live, always, for ourselves.\nThat's why Feng Yi never understands her. Never understands the one in the world most skilled at getting herself into trouble. Never understands why, when the Zhang family entrusted her with a child, she chose to wear the River Deity's mask. She is just a mortal. So why pretend to be an immortal? Why gild herself in myth, coat herself in mud, and become a clay idol for others to worship?""\nA Yu… was it worth it?"" Feng Yi finally asked.\nShe only smiled, eyes fixed on the shimmering currents of the Yellow River.\n""Maybe,"" she said, ""one day, what isn't worth it… will be.""\nAnd perhaps that day does come in the form of freezing rain from a colorless sky, of floodwaters surging higher than walls can hold, of city gates that will not open, and of her, collapsing lifeless into Feng Yi's arms.\n""Ah Yu,"" he whispered, ""It wasn't worth it.

b6eb98cdf56de646	"Tian Ying was a native of Qinghe. In his youth, he lived in poverty and remained unknown. He studied at the Inkbound Order before serving under Daoji, who held him in high esteem. \nWhen Emperor Shizong launched a campaign against the Liao Dynasty, the Liao ruler sent his uncle as an envoy to the Southern Tang. Daoji said to Tian Ying, ""This opportunity must not be missed—how foolish to let it slip!"" Tian Ying replied, ""The Liao envoy can be assassinated. Although the Southern Tang has the Aureate Guards, they lack the power to command troops. By intimidating them in this way, what can they do to us?"" Daoji praised him, saying, ""This is not about espionage but state affairs. You understand my intentions."" \nLater, the Southern Tang hosted a night banquet for the Liao envoy at Qingfeng Post . When the envoy withdrew to relieve himself after drinking heavily, he did not return for a long time—and was found decapitated. The Southern Tang ruler ordered the Aureate Pavilion to arrest Tian Ying, but he evaded capture. From then on, diplomatic relations between Liao and Southern Tang were severed, and Tian Ying was never seen again."

6bf21cbdb101feda	During the Tianyou era, the Baima Station Incident, orchestrated by Zhu Wen, claimed the lives of all Ten Sages of the Inkbound Order. Legend has it that, in order to preserve their teachings, the disciples spirited away several volumes from the Ten Sages' Collection—treatises on #YYin-Yang Ultimate Arts#E—and vanished into the secluded reaches of Qinghe, leaving no trace behind. Some believe they remained steadfast, founding an academy to keep the sages' wisdom alive despite the threats of the Liang court. Others say they chose seclusion, leading tranquil lives among waterfowl, untouched by worldly matters, as if they had transcended the mortal realm.\nDecades later, during the Xiande era, Emperor Shizong of Later Zhou restored the old imperial gardens and #Ybuilt the Peace Bell Tower#E, hoping its chimes would usher in peace for the world. It was then that a villager reportedly discovered fragments of ancient scrolls and cloth on the mountainside, said to be remnants of the Inkbound Order. Could these be the lost books of the Ten Sages? I am inclined to believe so.

3917666a37c557e6	Xue Chou of Kaifeng, a man of mixed Hu and Han descent, was born with an unknown original name. In his youth, he apprenticed under Old Man Xue, mastering miraculous arts: treading on fire and blades, transplanting melons and wells, conjuring clouds and mists at will, and shaping mountains and rivers from thin air—feats that left onlookers in awe. Chou was renowned for his cunning. He assisted Ghostlight Market Elder and Dao Lord Zhu Yousheng in founding the Nine Mortal Ways to resist the Khitan forces, winning great prestige among the people for his strategic acumen.\nAfter Zhu Yousheng's death and as his disciples came of age, Xue Chou retired to oversee the Oil Umbrella faction. He often performed illusionary acts in the Fairgrounds, gaining renown for his craft. When envoys from various states converged on the capital, the Emperor wished to stage a performance to showcase imperial might and entrusted the task to Chou.\nIf later generations of jianghu practitioners are destined to meet him, they may seek his trace at the Beast Reverie Stage in the Fairgrounds—perhaps they will find what they seek.

9d17fcceb518c90f	"The Shuowen Jiezi explains: ""The character bo means a horse of impure color."" Among the famed Khitan Iron Hooves, those with such a mixed, dark coat were known as Wubo.\nAccording to the History of Liao: ""In old Khitan custom, wealth lay in horses and strength in arms."" As nomads, the Khitan roamed with their herds, raising horses along rivers and pastures. When war came, armored cavalry would assemble at dawn at the emperor's command. Their horses, raised on wild pastures and sustained by nature, were famed for endurance, strength, and composure, earning them the name ""Khitan Iron Hooves."" With the founding of the Liao Dynasty, a dedicated Horse Herd Office was established to manage the imperial herds.\nThe Khitan Iron Hoof is compact, with short, sturdy limbs and small, round hooves that rarely crack. Nimble and sure-footed, it navigates rugged mountain terrain as if it were level ground. Calm in nature, tolerant of rough feed, and long-lived, this versatile horse could carry both rider and load, making it the most common and essential steed of the Liao Dynasty."

That one time earned her the nickname ""Crabapple Flower"" for her tipsy beauty—but also taught her that the seniors hadn't lied: wine could be bitter too. She never got drunk again.\nUntil, after countless years, she met a young wanderer.\nHe stood before her, sweating, clutching a jar of Crabapple Wine, eyes full of earnest warmth. As she looked into those eyes, she suddenly understood another lesson from her elders: in a chaotic world, innocence and kindness truly move the heart.\nIt felt as if all those years of resistance to wine came crashing down at once. She grew drowsy, so much so she didn't notice the jade ring she always carried fall into the cup.\n""Just a little longer... drunk for a moment, as short as spring.""\nWith that thought, Hua Jieyu lay beside him, and gently closed her eyes."

Steadfast in their creed to protect the people and defend the cities they were a stalwart line of defense against the Khitan and a shield to the realm. However, during Emperor Shizong's reign, the court refused to wage war on the Khitan. Feeling their mission betrayed and their loyalty discarded, the Tigers in Chains turned to darkness. Following Ye Wanshan's order, they slaughtered an entire city and pinned the blame on the Khitan, hoping to force the imperial court into action. Wracked with guilt, the soldiers ultimately chose to bind themselves in chains and enter the Pagoda of Karma with their general, seeking redemption for their unforgivable crime. \nBut now, troubling news stirs once more. General Ye Wanshan has been released, and his whereabouts are unknown.

The original Hualiu was one of the legendary Eight Steeds of King Mu of Zhou, and its name later came to describe all fine horses of this pure red color, which are considered the most prized among the Southwestern Ponies.\nLegends from the Huayang Chorography tell of a divine steed that once rose from Dianchi Lake. Its offspring, known as ""Dianchi Foals,"" were said to travel five hundred li a day. Later, during the Tang and Song dynasties, texts like the Book of the Man and the New Book of Tang praised the swift, high-tailed horses bred on the lush grasslands of the region, famed as ""Yuetan Steeds."" These Dian Horses, named for their origin near Dianchi Lake, are also known as Southwestern Ponies.\nSmall in stature, they have fine limbs, a short neck, a broad forehead, and firm, compact hooves. Prized for their endurance, they are suited for riding, pulling, and carrying loads, making them the most common breed in the southwest."

b45b44dd94b9144d	Braised Pork Belly Slices is said to have originated from ancient sacrificial rites. After the rites, the sacrificial meat will be cut into rectangular chunks, tied with cattail or rush grass into bundles, and distributed to the participants to take home and braise in soy sauce, gradually evolving into the dish known today. Another folk tale traces its origins to the Oath of the Peach Garden at the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty. After Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei took an oath of fraternity in the Peach Garden, Zhang made a dish of stewed pork. Though the story is not recorded in official history and is likely a later embellishment, it adds a colorful layer to the dish's legacy.

The status of Mercyheart Monastery will never be the same. Could he truly be… a Buddha? (The following lines are aggressively overwritten with fresh ink—only broken phrases like ""collusion"" and ""scheming"" can be discerned.)\n\nSecond Month, First Year of the Jianlong Era\nSince the Master left the monastery, not a word has been heard. I fear the worst. Tomorrow, I shall depart to seek him.\n\nThird Month, First Year of the Jianlong Era\nMiaoshan—from start to finish, it was all a lie. ""Holy monk of the Dharma?"" A fraud, bloated on stolen reverence! Had I not uncovered these old letters, I might have died shackled to his deceit. Tian Ying ensnared me with Buddhist platitudes, turning me into his accomplice for years. My life, half-wasted! I will have vengeance.\nNow, recalling the ""Dharma"" that charlatan preached for over a decade, I feel only revulsion. The Twelve Nidānas? Fabrications. The Three Realms and Six Paths? Delusions! From this day forth: All that sings Buddha's praise I defy. All that Buddha abhors I will glorify. Why should clay idols lord over the living? If he could pose as a Bodhisattva… why not I?\n\nFourth Month, First Year of the Jianlong Era\nEven now, fools chant Amitabha and cling to Tian Ying's lies. Disgusting! Fortunately, Huiyong and his bandit-born brethren long despised Tian's faction. Together, we drove those swine out. Now, not a whiff of Buddhism taints Mercyheart Monastery. At last… peace!"

e97eda555c158310	The moonlight glows through pine trees, clear springs flow over stone. \nAutumn Dusk Dwelling sits by the water, a quiet mountain dwelling nestled in the Plainfield. Shen Yilun, Master of Grain, once offered a grand estate within the city by the Song court, declined it, choosing instead to reside here in solitude. \nKnown for his creed to keep the realm ever-normal, Shen advocated for building the granary, and emergency lending to aid the people. To the common folk, he was a man of deep virtue. Yet after surviving an assassination attempt during a southern inspection, he withdrew from public events, living in seclusion. It leaves one to wonder: can even the purest hearts lose their way?

Among the Tuyuhun horses, those with such an uneven, bluish-mottled coat were called Qingbo, or Azure Piebalds.\nLegends say the Ganlong region produced fine ""Qin Horses"" as early as the Qin Dynasty. Later, the Tuyuhun people settled there to graze their herds. According to the Book of Sui, a myth tells of a Persian stallion that bred with a local mare near Qinghai Lake, producing a Cong colt that could run a thousand li a day. This legendary colt became known as the Tuyuhun Horse.\nMuscular and well-proportioned, the Tuyuhun Horse is strong yet gentle and easy to train. These horses are highly social, moving in herds led by a dominant stallion. With keen ears and sharp eyes, they are intelligent, alert, and fiercely loyal to both their kind and their master. Suited for riding and light draft work, they became one of the most common breeds in the Central Plains."

Since infiltrating Qinghe, the pavilion has abducted living souls to forge Sleeping Puppets, massacred outposts, and invaded Blissful Retreat. Their motives appear to go beyond mere vengeance for the Breeze Post Incident.

8600e26b26fea767	It was Zi hour again.\nFaceless lay on the dark room's floor, listening intently. This was her chance. The guests had left, and the guards were asleep. If she could push open the door, follow the dim red lanterns, and crawl through that shadowy tunnel… she could escape. She'd mapped the route in her mind a hundred times, she had to make it.\nWith bloodied, mud-caked hands, she trembled to her elbows. The wooden pendant at her waist scraped the floor, making a faint noise. She froze, breath held, fingers crusted with scabs. Gritting her teeth, she tried again, but collapsed with a thud.\nHer eyes fell to her legs, and she sighed silently. The Unbound Cavern had broken her left leg during her last escape, her right, the time before. A month had passed, and she'd thought the pain would ease. She'd overestimated herself.\nThe pain came swiftly, piercing to the bone. Tears and blood mingled as they streamed down her face, soon blurring her vision. She instinctively raised a hand to wipe them away, only to be met with even sharper agony. Then she remembered, yes, the time before last, in her struggle against those people, she had deliberately ruined her own face.\nShe propped herself up, momentarily dazed, but clarity quickly returned. No. She must escape. She had to get out. Broken legs could heal. A ruined face wouldn't make her mother love her less. If she could just get out... if she could just return to her mother's side... Gritting her teeth, she dragged herself forward. One painful crawl. Then another. However, the door burst open with a crash.\n\nThe dim red candlelight spilled into the room, swirling dust particles in the air. Faceless finally closed her eyes in despair... It felt like an eternity since she'd left home. Where was mother now? What was she doing? Did she still think of her? As these thoughts flooded her mind, a rough hand clamped around her jaw, forcing her mouth open as bitter medicine poured down her throat. A single tear escaped her eye.\nThis ditch of rotting shadows would be her grave after all.

e5b4b1f8ee11bb71	"""What should I bring if I'm heading to the jianghu?""\n\nEight-year-old Xiao Shi asked the martial arts master his father had hired, legs locked in a horse stance.\n\nThe old man, sitting on top of a rockery in their courtyard, snorted and tossed a pebble at his knee.\n\n""What should you bring? Your father's curses.""\n\nBack then, Xiao Shi was a walking disaster—climbing rooftops, running off from home, brawling other kids with wooden swords. If there was a way to infuriate his father, he'd find it and do it twice. Deputy General Xiao, already burdened with court affairs by day, would wake in the middle of the night muttering, ""That damn brat,"" before tossing and turning again. The little house on the backside of the Xiao estate became Xiao Shi's regular haunt. How often he stayed depended on how many times he'd driven his father out of bed cursing.\n\nWhenever the servants heard shouts like ""Help! Murder's a crime!"" Echoing from that room, they'd sigh and mutter, ""Young Master's upset the lord again.""\n\nLately, the deputy commander had added two more locks to that door.\n\nThis was their worst fight yet.\n\n""If you dare let me out, I swear I'll leave this wretched place in a heartbeat! I'm going to roam the jianghu!""\n\n""As for that Miss Shen, even if you beat me to death, I'm not marrying her!""\n\nAfter that ""wretched place"" rant, one more lock was added the next morning. By midday, after the ""beat me to death"" declaration, Deputy General Xiao gave the door a good kicking:\n\n""No sense of right or wrong!""\n\nBut Xiao Shi didn't think he lacked a sense of right and wrong. He already had it figured out. There were only two kinds of things in this world—what he liked and what he didn't. What he liked was right. What he didn't was wrong. And he had already decided to only do the right things.\n\nHe knew from long ago he wouldn't stay here forever. If he ever went out into the jianghu, he'd take just two things: a flute and a sword. The sword to spar. The flute to play after winning, and to tell stories. Stories he heard, stories he lived.\n\n""And who would you tell them to?""\n\n""Doesn't matter who hears them. What matters is the story itself! But I can tell you one thing—it sure won't be Miss Shen. I really don't like her."""

1faeaba09055573a	"The River Deity's name carried weight in Kaifeng. But who the River Deity truly was remained a mystery.\n\nSome said the River Deity was a member of the Zhang clan of Roaring Sands, once influential in the river transport trade since the Han Dynasty, only to fall from grace and serve the Khitan as dogs.\nOthers said the River Deity was part of the Loong Jiao Hall, wearing blue robes, red sleeves, and Nuo Dance Mask, skilled with both sword and fan, and known for healing the sick. This was the same Zhu Yu who had earned her fame in the Khitan wars.\n\nStill, others whispered that the River Deity was just a name, a cursed title that brought endless suffering. Those who carried it lived a life of toil, with no other path to follow. When people turned to see who dared speak such blasphemy, they found only a salty fish vendor, chewing on a blade of grass, wearing straw sandals, and looking half-asleep. ""Just a market joke, nothing serious. Or hey, take a look at this salted fish, top quality!"" The crowd burst into laughter, dismissing the vendor's words. After all, who would take a fishmonger seriously?\n\nFeng Yi, for one, hated being confined. The jianghu was vast, meant to be roamed freely. Yet he couldn't escape his confinement, just as Kaifeng's people had been trapped under the blades of the Khitan. When the city fell, ordinary people were lucky if they weren't slaughtered like livestock. Heroes and outlaws stepped up to save lives, but what did that have to do with a mere fishmonger like Feng Yi? He could have laughed at himself for the thought, but as he wandered through the abandoned Verdant Hill Village, a Khitan warrior suddenly brought a blade crashing down on him.\n\nStories of heroes saving damsels in distress were common in the storybooks. But Feng Yi wasn't a damsel, nor a hero. The green-robed, red-sleeved woman before him deflected the Khitan's blade with a single stroke, then turned and stomped him into the ground. That was how the salted fish vendor met his match, pinned underfoot. It wasn't exactly romantic, though the sword that saved his life was unforgettable.\n\nIt was not until much later that Feng Yi learned that Zhu Yu had been exhausted that day, brewing medicinal soup with the Lamp-lighting Monk. And much later still, he would drink Zhu Yu's soup and join the Loong Jiao Hall. The gang members under Zhu Yu were ordinary people: plain in appearance, average in skill, living lives as fragile as anyone else's. Yet their courage and ambition were anything but ordinary. Today, we drive out the Khitans. Tomorrow, we'll calm the Yellow River, bringing peace and ending the storms. Ordinary people wouldn't believe such words. But when Zhu Yu said them, they carried the weight of mountains, and no one could doubt her.\n\n""Today, we drive out the Khitans. Tomorrow, we'll calm the Yellow River, bringing peace and ending the storms,"" Feng Yi murmured, unable to stop himself."

f1d9af75debbfb5d	"It wasn't until she stepped into the Eternal Solitude Hall that Zhu Yu truly understood the meaning of divinity. Some ascend to godhood to stand above all others. But the ""River Deitys"" were greedier still. They sought, while still mortal, to fight fate itself from the heavens. Yu the Great, Li Bing, Wang Jing… Only those who dared defy the sky itself were worthy to become River Deitys, the eternal sovereigns of water.\n\nIn this world, victory and defeat are always fair. Where there is triumph, there must also be failure; where something is lost, something else is gained. If the Loongs of the Four Rivers' myths truly existed, then the Loong King of this place must surely be the most wretched of them all. Zhu Yu glanced back at the ""Loong King"" who only had one tail left. She tossed over a bottle of elixirs. It wasn't a panacea, but if it could ease a little of the Loong's suffering, was that not reason enough? Following Zhang Yanqing's method, it wasn't long before the Loong King recognized her as master.\n\nThe Storyteller speaks: the long-gone River Deity reappeared during the Khitan retreat. He rode a Loong into battle, wielding his sword to command the waters. The muddy torrents rose into nine heavenly loongs, devouring warships to the east, shattering boats to the west, and drowning tens of thousands of Khitan soldiers, dragging them into oblivion!\n\n""It wasn't nearly that dramatic,"" Zhu Yu chuckled, patting the Loong King's head. \n\n""You just looked so strange you scared them off."" She tossed another bottle of elixirs.\n\nThe Loong King grumbled in protest, flicked its fin to splash a few drops of water at her, then dove back beneath the surface, no longer willing to entertain the humor of its mischievous master."

When hitting any unit afflicted with your own Bleed effect, based on the number of Bleed stacks, there is a #Y60%#E/#Y70%#E/#Y80%#E/#Y90%#E/#Y100%#E chance to add 1 extra Combo count, and the duration of all buff effects is extended by #Y3#E seconds. Sober Sorrow damage increased by #Y10%#E. During its channel, you gain #Y60%#E Damage Reduction and significantly increased resistance to interruption. When Combo count reaches 10, you gain the potent River Flow effect: Damage increased by #Y25%#E, and the Special Skill Sweep a Thousand Armies restores HP based on 20% of the damage dealt. If Sober Sorrow deals at least 5 hits to the same target within 3 seconds, it applies 1 stack of Spirit-Startling effect and the Wine Gu effect lasting 15 seconds: Damage taken from the effect source is increased by #Y5%#E.

Defense-breaking Mystic Skills not only ignore deflect but also deal enhanced effects when hitting targets who are defending or deflecting. However, these Mystic Skills can be interrupted by any skill. \n\nPlayer skills, including Mystic Skills and Charged Skill, can interrupt Light and Heavy Attacks, but not vice versa. \n\nEffective use of Control-breaking Skills can turn the tide. \n\nDefeating your rival grants 1v1 Arena Points. Heroes with the higher points will enter the Arena Leaderboard. \n\nIn 1v1 Arena, player Healing effects are reduced by 90%; Damage to targets' HP Shields is increased by 100%.

Yet ever since the sudden rise of Lament Scriptorium, Taihu Li Syrup's popularity has been in decline every day. To compete with Lamentation Heavens, Li Syrup picked up the pace and churned out tale after tale. Only to unwittingly reveal clues to their true identity between the lines.\n\nAfter countless secret investigations conducted by devoted storybook fans, the truth finally came to light: the romantic wordsmith behind Taihu Li Syrup was none other than Han Yanluo, the famed ""Ice-Faced Fairy"" of the Masked Troupe. The news stunned the jianghu. Then again, in hindsight, ""Li Syrup,"" ""Masked Troupe"", the hints were there all along. Since its founding, the Masked Troupe had been devoted to dramatizing the legends of the martial world, crafting countless poignant classics. Yet in recent years, their output dwindled, overshadowed by the Lamentation Heavens. As a direct disciple of the Masked Troupe's master, how could Han Yanluo not be anxious? Her feverish writing was likely her way of proving that Masked Troupe is still the king of all storybooks, an effort both lamentable and admirable."

6b75b2cad1c219ce	"Yi Dao had to admit, he'd spent his whole life hunting hawks, but never thought he'd get pecked in the eye by a sparrow. Maybe it was because they'd worked so well together in that wine cellar that he'd mistakenly started to trust the little brat. Until that sly kid tricked him again, leaving him in a sorry state, only to be rescued by Han Xiangxun herself. Yi Dao wanted to let out a long sigh—Forget it. No point holding a grudge against a snot-nosed brat.\nHe hadn't forgotten his true purpose, hadn't forgotten the promise he came for—a promise worth more than gold. But the Jianghu had grown desolate, old friends scattered to the wind. When he delivered the news to Han Xiangxun and saw that fleeting emptiness in her eyes, Yi Dao felt uneasy. He was never good at handling such moments, and never wanted to see the faces of those left behind. There was something in her eyes, in her expression, that made his heart go numb. Jianghu, damn this wretched jianghu!\n\n""I've always wanted to see what the Jianghu outside is like,"" the kid said. Yi Dao almost laughed. You? Want to go into the Jianghu? Please. With that sharp tongue of yours, who knows how many people you'd offend just by talking? People out there aren't as easygoing as me; push them too far and they won't let you off so easily... But then, he thought, the kid was very much like himself.\nHeaven's Pier was a good place, but it was too small, too fragile to withstand a fledgling's first attempt to soar like a roc. You can't keep it in; even if the wings are still soft, that young bird will stumble and try to fly, again and again, out of the nest—even if outside is a bottomless abyss, and falling means being smashed to pieces.\nForget it, Yi Dao thought. ""Come on, I'll take you to Kaifeng!"" As long as Yi Dao was around, he'd never let that kid fall and shatter to pieces."

The villagers refused to heed his words and drove him away.\nNot long after, heavenly fire descended like a blazing canopy, consuming the village in an inferno. Houses vanished into a sea of flames, and for ten miles, nothing remained but scorched earth—none survived.\nSome years later, in the Jianlong era, as travelers passed the desolate ruins in the depths of night, one heard the sound of quiet weeping rising from the wasteland. He said to his companions, ""Could these be the lonely spirits of the villagers, still unwilling to find peace?"""

Once the match begins, up to four teams with similar ranking points will be grouped into a round-robin bracket. Each group will play three matches, with each match using a best-of-three format. Teams that win a match will earn Season Points and Engagement tokens.\n\nIn this mode, healing effects are reduced by 70%. After a certain time in battle, players will deal increased damage while healing effectiveness is further reduced. Using the ""Deflection"" skill consumes Endurance, but successfully executing a finisher restores it.\n\nMost player skills can be countered using ""Deflection."" However, Armor-Piercing Mystic Skills can't be blocked this way and are especially effective against defensive targets or those using ""Deflection""—though they can be interrupted by any skill.\n\nVarious player skills (including Mystic Skills and Charged Skills) can interrupt light and heavy attacks, but not the other way around.\n\nMastering crowd-control removal skills can turn the tide of battle when at a disadvantage.\n\nThe side that defeats all players of the other first within the time limit wins. If the timer runs out without a decisive outcome, the winner is determined by the following priorities: 1. The side with more surviving players wins; 2. If the number of surviving players is equal, the side with the higher total damage dealt wins; 3. If the total damage dealt is equal, the side with the higher total healing amount wins."

The jianghu was thrown into uproar, rife with speculation: Who was the assassin? What was the true bond between the Star Stealer and Zhao Pu? What secrets lay hidden beneath the surface?\nSome say the legendary Canglang Sword Manual, stolen by the Star Stealer during the battle at Wolf Mountain, is hidden somewhere within Zhao's mansion. Perhaps, if fate allows, future seekers may uncover the truth for themselves."

He studied at the Inkbound Order before serving under Daoji, who held him in high esteem. \nWhen Emperor Shizong launched a campaign against the Liao Dynasty, the Liao ruler sent his uncle as an envoy to the Southern Tang. Daoji said to Tian Ying, ""This opportunity must not be missed—how foolish to let it slip!"" Tian Ying replied, ""The Liao envoy can be assassinated. Although the Southern Tang has the Aureate Guards, they lack the power to command troops. By intimidating them in this way, what can they do to us?"" Daoji praised him, saying, ""This is not about espionage but state affairs. You understand my intentions."" \nLater, the Southern Tang hosted a night banquet for the Liao envoy at Qingfeng Post . When the envoy withdrew to relieve himself after drinking heavily, he did not return for a long time—and was found decapitated. The Southern Tang ruler ordered the Aureate Pavilion to arrest Tian Ying, but he evaded capture. From then on, diplomatic relations between Liao and Southern Tang were severed, and Tian Ying was never seen again."

41effb4b1c74aae0	"""Master, what's going on between you and Madam Han?""\nUnfated Tian set down the medical book, unhurried as ever.\n""That's what you care about? Not my secret skills?""\nDou Doudou shrank back, grinding his pestle like he was smashing garlic. ""Nope, not interested, not at all. Master—okay, I'll stop asking. If you never get married, you'll be stuck living with me when you're old...""\n""Just an old bachelor, how tragic.""\nDoudou muttered loudly, and Yaoyao made a face.\n\nUnfated Tian didn't bother teasing them further. The Water Lady and her boatman would never grow old; even at eighty, they'd still be the legendary pair on the river.\nBut these two kids—young, curious, always poking their noses into things—reminded him of another troublemaker back at Blissful Retreat.\nIf he hadn't seen Han Xiangxun raising a child years ago, he probably wouldn't have softened and taken these two in.\nKids and apprentices always come with strings attached.\nThinking of this, he straightened his back and put on his ""master"" face.\n""Have you memorized the medical book? Balanced the accounts? Let's see: for yesterday's patient with joint pain, how much poria, saposhnikovia, and atractylodes do you add to the prescription?""\nUnfated Tian was never one for strict discipline, so the two apprentices just grinned sheepishly and set to work faster.\n\nRumor had it around Blissful Retreat that Doctor Tian from Evercare Clinic and the owner of the tavern had something special between them.\nSometimes, patients would ask him about it—some outright, some just hinting. Unfated Tian would only smile, sometimes with a hint of sadness.\nHis friendly ways had put him in playful competition with Jiang Wulang for the role of Han Xiangxun's husband—all because whoever married her would get to help run the tavern.\nPeople always found ways to connect them, and it was far better than living as strangers, never crossing paths.\n\n""Today's job isn't like the usual. Not a word about this to anyone.""\nAfter they'd done that big job for Northern Vow, Han Xiangxun had leaned in close, her voice low and serious. The firelight warmed her face, making the cold underground seem less harsh.\nUnfated Tian only smiled, gentle as ever. The money for ferrying souls had long since gone—it didn't matter to him.\nWhat did matter was watching Han Xiangxun split with Chu Qingquan. Unfated Tian hadn't bothered hiding that he watched the whole thing.\nMaybe it was foolish, but he felt a secret happiness.\nThe more secrets they shared, the closer they felt.\nShe trusted him, and he knew more about her hidden side than anyone else—more even than Chu Qingquan.\n\nBut that day, she was someone he'd never seen before.\nHe watched her pour jar after jar of wine into the lake; the endless stream looked like tears she refused to shed.\nShe stared at the ripples in silence.\nUnfated Tian kept his distance.\nIn this life, only the Water Lady's boatman would never leave her—through all the storms, always there, if only she would turn and look.\nBut she never did.\nNot as the sharp, capable owner of Blissful Retreat, not as the Water Lady with a new face, knife in hand by the river.\nNot even now, by the water's edge—a woman mourning the past, heartbroken for love.\nJust like Unfated Tian himself, spending every night in the well, carefully pretending to be someone he wasn't.\n\nThey could be the doctor and tavern owner people whispered about, secret partners in the underworld, or the ""perfect couple"" the neighbors tried to match up.\nBut they could never truly be together.\nIn the end, two hearts could come as close as possible, but always stop just short—close enough to almost touch, forever a step apart."

He presided over Qinghe's restrictions on Buddhist practice and once even saved a Khitan man.\nTo this day, many in Qinghe still long for his return, hoping to see the Buddha's Light atop the mountain once more.

Among the Wusun Western Supreme horses, those with an uneven, mottled coat were called Jinbo, or Gold Piebalds.\nDuring the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, the nomadic Wusun kingdom in the Western Regions was renowned for its excellent horses. The Book of Han records how the envoy Zhang Qian returned from his mission with Wusun steeds. Struck by their majestic grace, Emperor Wu named them ""Western Supremes.""\nThese horses are large and muscular, with sturdy limbs, small heads, and clear eyes, giving them an elegant appearance. Gentle in temperament yet hardy, they fatten on grass in spring and summer and can dig through snow for forage in winter. Combining both strength and speed, they are suited for riding and pulling alike, making them a prized breed unique to the Western Regions."

If the number of surviving players is equal, the side with the higher total damage dealt wins;\n3. If the total damage dealt is equal, the side with the higher total healing amount wins.

0052bd174750e91c	Xue Chou of Kaifeng, a man of mixed Hu and Han descent, was born with an unknown original name. In his youth, he apprenticed under Old Man Xue, mastering miraculous arts: treading on fire and blades, transplanting melons and wells, conjuring clouds and mists at will, and shaping mountains and rivers from thin air—feats that left onlookers in awe. Chou was renowned for his cunning. He assisted Ghostlight Market Elder and Dao Lord Zhu Yousheng in founding the Nine Mortal Ways to resist the Khitan forces, winning great prestige among the people for his strategic acumen.\nAfter Zhu Yousheng's death and as his disciples came of age, Xue Chou retired to oversee the Oil Umbrella faction. He often performed illusionary acts in the Fairgrounds, gaining renown for his craft. When envoys from various states converged on the capital, the Emperor wished to stage a performance to showcase imperial might and entrusted the task to Chou.\nIf later generations of jianghu practitioners are destined to meet him, they may seek his trace at the Beast Reverie Stage in the Fairgrounds—perhaps they will find what they seek.

f5bbfba65cf6ab8c	Once known as the Loong Jiao Hall, they met with calamity in the first year of the Jianlong era, when a great flood ravaged Kaifeng, claiming the life of Zhu Yu. To uncover the truth behind Chai Rong's death, the River Deity Feng Yi forged the Water Great Wall and journeyed north to Yannan.\n\nSeizing this moment, the Song court, seeking control over river transport, imposed harsh decrees upon the Loong Jiao Clan, forcing it to splinter. Zhang Cuo led the Jade Serpent Hall to submit to Zhao-Song, while Feng Ruzhi led the Bloodscale Hall in defending the fortress of Heavenfall.

1ee9c6476f5fecea	"The Zhang clan of Roaring Sands built the Gourd Dike, offered white horses and jade to the river, and for generations tamed the waters by imperial decree, they became the River Deity.\n\nYoung Zhang Yanling never believed in fate. To him, fate was a yoke, locking a man's spine and skull to the earth from infancy, leaving him no room to struggle. As a boy, he envied the heroes from storytellers' tales, those who rode through Jianghu with unbridled freedom, who came and went like the wind, leaving no trace. They never had to spend their days studying ""Seven-Star Levee Ropes"" by the Gourd Dike, nor memorize the Water Administration Code word by word under lock and key. And they certainly didn't have to descend into shadowed halls, treading on bleached bones, to tame… the Zhang family's ""Loong.""\n\nWas this really fate? With that thought, Zhang Yanling went to the marketplace and picked out a fine white horse. He would flee to the desert's lone smoke in the far north, to the spring waters greener than indigo in Jiangnan. He would escape the Yellow River, whose veins dug deep into the heartlands, and every last trace of his predestined life.\n\nThe peach blossoms of the south bloomed fiercely, nothing like the barren banks of the Yellow River. But as Zhang Yanling rode, he brushed shoulders with a travel-worn woman in green. He returned the hat she'd dropped; she gifted him a pill she'd refined herself.\n""What kind of medicine is this?""\n""The life-saving kind.""\n""You've made so many. Who are you saving?""\n""An entire city. Kaifeng.""\n\nFate, it seemed, always seized you the moment you tried to run."

In hopes of securing peace in Jiangnan, The Shimmer of South sought out The Ember of East, then a fallen noble in Weiyang City, and offered him a path back home in exchange for executing the ""Gold-Making Vessel Theft"" scheme. Their aim is to exploit public outrage over the policy of confiscating Tang Coin, driving a wedge between Zhao court officials and the people, and halting the southern campaign. But The Ember of East, unwilling to see the people suffer, emerged in the Furnace and presented the Treasure Basin Plan, a proposal that reshaped the fate they had agreed upon. Though The Shimmer of South foresaw this change, he chose not to intervene. Compassion stayed his hand. For he, too, was devoted to protecting Jiangnan. And now, his true identity stands to be revealed...Dealing direct damage, deflecting, or performing a perfect dodge grant you one stack of #HJade#E. This effect can trigger once every 3 seconds.

I'm not some celestial being, just different in appearance. And I certainly can't ""shatter poison with a roar."" I'd only learned from Granny how to command venomous creatures, not conquer them.\nChen Huaiqing told me stories of the outside world, tales of the jianghu, of temples and schools, of festivals I'd never seen. I listened eagerly, but Granny warned me: ""Outsiders' hearts are poison. Look too long, and your eyes will rot."" She'd seen it herself in her youth, back when she roamed the martial world refining the Longevity Parasite. That's how she'd gone blind.\nBefore he left, Chen Huaiqing spoke of the jianghu's endless poison feuds. ""I need that antidote to save my family,"" he said. My resolve wavered. I stole Grandmother's formula, hid it inside a lantern, and gave it to him.\nHe carried that lantern out of the village, its glow flickering through the Deerforage Grove's mist like a struggling fire-moth.\nLater, I heard he'd proclaimed himself the ""Disciple of the Immortal Sage"". Yet he never sent word, never returned to thank me.\nGranny scolded me. ""You don't understand the cruelty of men's hearts. This is their nature. Kindness goes unrewarded.""\nThat year, for my birthday, she entrusted me with the Toad King. ""The Longevity Parasite lies within it,"" she said. ""Many covet it.

84ab29ee9bb77845	To my son, Zhang Cuo—\n\nIf you are reading this letter, I do not know how many years have passed since my death. Have the Khitan armies retreated? Have you grown into a man? Does the title of River Deity still endure? As I write down these words, the Khitan are butchering the capital. Bian is a city of broken souls, the River Deity's seat stands vacant, and there is no one left to take command. I could not refuse, so I took upon Yanlin's mantle and became the River Deity.\n\nThe enemy crossed south at Mengjin, soon to reach Roaring Sands. Our armies, knowing Jin had fallen, locked their gates, put down their arms, and fled at the mere sound of enemy drums. Our villagers had no way to escape. I heard once that Yannan had a city that held fast for months without surrender—yet when it finally fell, every soul within it was butchered, a thousand miles of white bones, fresh ghosts replacing the old.\n\nAlas! Ever since the Zhang family… (text blurred)... Now, our people are but women, children, and the elderly. Though I bear the River Deity's name, I do not...(blurred)...my power is shallow. Even with...in hand, I cannot command even a fraction of the power of the Loong King. In this desperate hour, I have conceived a reckless plan...Zhang to use the River Deity's false name to quell the people's despair... I have never cared much for the judgment of the world. To fake surrender to Khitan and stain my name with infamy, to bow to the conquerors and be remembered as a traitor. No one would do it, but I would. To trade honor for survival, others flinch at it. I force them to endure it.\n\nSince ancient times, all men must die, yet how rare are those who die for righteousness? Better to exchange one man's disgrace for a thousand lives' peace. What greater fortune could there be?\n\nThis matter is delicate beyond words. Thanks to Luo... (text blurred) to succeed. Within the Khitan ranks...members of our own... This must never reach outside ears! Remember! Remember it well! Feng and Zhu, my two brothers-in-arms, swore blood oaths before the Eternal Solitude Hall—to protect...\n\nOf all I owe in this life, none weighs heavier than the debt I owe you, A'Cuo. To think of the hardships you must endure, even a hundred lives could not atone for it. The sorrow and regret within me, a thousand words could not express. Yet the enemy drums sound once more. Feng and Zhu will be here in no time. I must put down my pen... My only prayer is that you may grow up in a world of peace, and that you may live a happy and peaceful life.

d755a81d794f519d	\nCai Zhu, my wife, I have wanted to write this letter for years. But I never knew how to begin, I feared that if I spoke, our life would shatter into pieces. Yet I feared more that after my death, no one would ever know who I was or where I came from. As my illness worsens day by day, so does my dread… So I write this at last, to tell you everything.\n\nI lied to you. I am not a soldier of the Northern Vow. I am Khitan, and my true name is Xiaoluoge, the name of our mother river in Khitan. Over a decade ago, I was conscripted into the army, torn from the Xiaoluoge River to this place, Qinghe. Qinghe has its own rivers, and people living by them, so like my hometown… I could not bear to raise my sword against them, so I fled.\n\nI escaped through Qinghe's tunnels, only to meet a soldier from the Northern Vow. He was alone, but his eyes looked at me like a wolf's. I… feared that gaze. I begged him, emptied my pockets for him, even took off the ox-horn necklace close to my heart, the one my mother made to bless me. But we could not understand each other's words. I thought I would die there.\n\nBut to my shock, he hesitated, then sheathed his sword. He took nothing from me. He placed the necklace back in my hand and let me go. When I crawled out of the tunnel, I saw my clansmen chasing me, diving into the very tunnel I had just escaped. And the man, my savior, was still inside…\n\nI was a coward… I did not dare go back. I ran, not even daring to look back. He saved me, but I could not bring myself to help him. Am I not despicable?\n\nLater, the Khan withdrew his troops, but I could never return. A deserter has no place to go home. I buried my savior's body and found a contract on him. I learned his name, Cui Xiaojin.\n\nAfter that, I stayed in Qinghe, grew my hair long, learned the Han language, pretended to be a Han man. Then I met you… The rest, you know.\n\nI meant to send my savior back to his hometown sooner, but Harvestfall Village was full of former soldiers. I feared they would recognize me. Wait until the wheat ripens. Wait until we marry. Wait until our daughter grows older. I kept telling myself this, but I never moved. Now, with only days left, I know I can wait no longer.\n\nI will take my savior home. When I return, I will give you this letter. Then… whatever you choose to do, I will accept.\n\nBut I want you to know: I will always remember the day we met under the maple tree on Moonveil Mountain.
